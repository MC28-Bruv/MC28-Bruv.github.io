    <h2>Why I'm demotivated</h2>
    <p>Ok. It just feels like every time I make a version of S-FL, something makes me have to lose the project files. It was first me switching over to unity, then my computer breaking so I had to use my brother's, and then me getting a new computer. It's nearly impossible to sustain a build of the game. And recently, I've wanted to make more games. I have multiple ideas, but this game is standing in the way. I'm perfectly fine with just making demos and letting you choose which ones I should continue, but right now, it really doesn't make things any better.</p>
    
    <p>As for the quality of the game, I am perfectly content with it. It may be cheap, but I have a very limited budget of 0 dollars. Most assets are created by myself since most good assets need me to cough up every last penny I have. The only thing holding me back is that I'm too lazy to finish a single level. ████████'s level is fairly easy, but animation code wasn't carried over from the last build. Speaking of which...</p>
    
    <p>The current build isn't made from scratch. I like to reuse builds if I have to start over, or at least replicate portions exactly how I originally made them. For example, the original full build was built on top of a small demo I had made in Scratch (the full build was in Turbowarp). I'm lucky that I chose simple designs, since then I could recreate them quickly if I do end up losing the models. I mean, Skoi is literally just made up of parts from Paint 3d!</p>
    
    <p>In conclusion, if you want a full version of Sci-Fi Labs sooner, and you know how to use Unity, DM me on Discord (mc28onccyeah), or email me (mc28dude@gmail.com). I want to get a full version out within the next month. :D</p>
