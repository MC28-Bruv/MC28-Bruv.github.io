    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>I am John Marker.</p>
    <p>A seller on Ebay had a cartridge for sale of some old GameBoy game made by the short lived ValeSoft Games.</p>

    <p>You can play it <a href="/happy-town/game">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The source can be found <a href="https://github.com/MC28-Bruv/MC28-Bruv.github.io/tree/main/happy-town">here</a>.</p>

    <h1>Mysteries</h1>

    <h2>Confirmed anomalies</h2>
    <p>On most installations, this is the main game:
        You start out as a young boy, waking up. You leave your house and you can talk to some townsfolk. Chances are you talk to the Woman. She has lost flowers for her husband in the forest, which is near a glitching house. Many areas in this game are very corrupted. When you enter it, you can walk into one of the 3 opened areas. In that area, you will find a flower. Trying to interact with the flower will make another character come to you, warning you that it is poisonous. The character looks identical to your character. It leaves and when you get into the main area, another area is opened, which was previously blocked by a rock. You can talk to the character again or collect the flowers. You can walk back to the Woman and she will take them. She will apologize for something happening to your crops, which did not happen in the game yet. The player's character seems to acknowledge this as well. You will be instructed to go to sleep, which just means go back to your house and get into your bed.</p>

    <p>You are then loaded into the second level of the game. In this level, the player leaves again. However, in place of where the woman was, there is a grave. Now, you can talk to the Old Man, who will ask you for a shovel (while being fairly pissed that you are talking to him). In the forest, The previous two areas are blocked off, and there is one area open, the bottom one. Going through it will bring you to an area identical to the first area. You can grab a shovel, which is where the flower was before. You can go back to the old man and give him the shovel. He says to go away or else he will drown your crops again, which hasn't happened either. You go back to bed.</p>

    <p>The final level is fairly short, simply being you grabbing a fruit. The game will crash in most cases. One of the kids can be talked to, where they will prompt you for a fruit.</p>

    <h2>Rare Anomalies</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, some cartridges have been reported to have some other anomalies. These mainly range from areas being more or less corrupted. We even found one that had no corruptions. It crashed right as you interact with the first flower though.</p>

    <p>However, there are some anomalies that are stranger.</p>

    <h3>Police being called</h3>
    <p>The first time you talk to the old man, he says to leave or else he will call the police. If you disregard his warning, like 11 year old Makayla Roberts, the police will be called to your location, dispite the GameBoy not having a way of tracking your location, much less being able to call the cops. The 911 responder said that the call had said that there was someone sexually harrassing an 11 year old. Makayla Roberts was brought in shortly after for questioning, and the game was taken off shelves shortly after.</p>

    <h3>A+A+Start</h3>
    <p>In some cartridges, in the main forest area, you can press A twice and then start to bring you to a secret location. This has 3 files (which were extracted), and as well as a glitching Old Man. None of them seem to do anything.</p>

    <h3>Secret 4th Level</h3>
    <p>One user reported a 4th level in their copy. No other report has been found, so this is probably fraudulent. They stated that it had an image of Elliot and Melody, the founder of ValeSoft and his daughter, staring at them. For some reason, about a month later, they have been murdered in their apartment. Fingerprints at the scene were not biologically possible, perfectly shaping numbers and various gaming consoles at the time that Elliot Vale had been thinking about porting Happy Town to.</p>

    <h3>you see me</h3>
    <p>i know you do.</p>

    <h1>Why wasn't the cops called?</h1>
    <p>ValeSoft Games was shortly afterwards sued by Nintendo of America for $70,000, making them go bankrupt.</p>
    <p>There has been some speculation that Melody, the daughter of the founder of ValeSoft, was put within the game, but I personally do not believe this.</p>
